This is a project that we created in a first sem for a python course. The code is run from the menu.py file. On running the code, you are displayed with a UI containing 4 buttons: 

The first button allows you to start playing the game - A pop up appears which ask the player to enter their name before the game starts. The game begins the game is run on pygame. 

There is a timer on the window which shows you the time that you have survived. Once the player dies or when the game is over, their score is recorded in an SQL table at the back end.
The second button is to view the leaderboard which contains the highest score and the time that the person has survived. It also ranks them in ascending order. The data is retrieved from the SQL table and displayed on the window.

The third button allows you to read the rules of the game.

The fourth button allows you to exit the game. 

More about the code is explained in the presentation.
